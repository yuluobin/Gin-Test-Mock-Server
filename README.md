# Gin-Test-Mocker-Server
A mock server (simply)

## Note
- The mock server is in the directory /mockServer. All other remaining is a distributed file system for my personal final project, for test purpose.
- Since the file system is running on Zookeeper, for testing you should run Zookeeper server on the local machine (default zk port is `127.0.0.1:2181`).
